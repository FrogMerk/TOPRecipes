    <p>
      This bolognese recipe literally saved my life, no word of a lie. I was
      <strong>straight up</strong> outta beef and had to run to the supermarket.
      While i was out my house <strong>LITERALLY</strong> burned down...
    </p>
    <p>
      Now was that my fault because i left the stovetop on with a teatowel lying
      all too close by?
    </p>
    <p>Maybe.</p>
    <p>
      Either way, now I have no house, but at least I have this kick-ass
      bolognese recipe. You should really give this one a go!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 Brown onion - finely diced</li>
      <li>3 Cloves of garlic, finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 Carrot - finely diced</li>
      <li>
        500g Minced Beef. (Try and get something fatty, lean beef is not what
        we're after here)
      </li>
      <li>500ml Beef stock, if possible avoid bouillon cubes</li>
      <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
      <li>
        &frac12;tsp Nutmeg - please, please buy whole nutmeg and grate it for
        this, pre-ground just won't be the same
      </li>
      <li>A handful of fresh rosemary</li>
      <li>
        400g Tinned tomatoes. (Aim to get something italian here, with real
        tomato kick)
      </li>
      <li>A good glug of red wine</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Firstly we're going to brown off the onions in 2tbsp olive oil over a
          medium heat. This should make sure they start to break down and get
          translucent, we want to move on once we start to see some fond
          developing on the bottom of the pan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you have that fond developing, add your garlic and give it 30
          seconds to cool, or until you can really smell them. Then add your
          carrots, keep stirring occasionally to make sure nothing catches on
          the pot.
        </p>
        <p>
          Continue to cook your carrots for a further 3-5 minutes depending on
          how finely they are diced, all the while watching the fond develop, if
          it's looking like burning, adjust the heat down to compensate.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Once your carrots have sweated enough and your fond is developing, add
          your beef in and raise the temperature a little. We're looking to
          brown off the meat and keep adding to that caramelisation on the
          bottom of the pan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Keep everything moving frequently at this point and make sure your
          stock is on standby.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once your meat is mostly browned and the fond is reaching a critical
          point, pour about 50-80 ml (no need to be too accurate, just eyeball
          this) into the pot and quickly start to use it to lift the fond off
          the bottom of the pot, stirring well to incorporate. Turn the heat
          down at this point.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Add in your herbs now, oregano and rosemary, along with the half
          teaspoon of nutmeg and season well. This will all add flavour
          throughout the cook, the nutmeg especially will give this a subtle
          twist that works incredibly well with the sweetness of the carrots.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Add in the remainder of your stock, the tinned tomatoes and give the
          bolognese a good glug of red wine to add to the depth of flavour. The
          pot should now hold quite a lot of liquid, don't worry, this will
          reduce over time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Adjust the heat to bring the pot to a slow simmer and partially cover
          the pot, to keep heat in, but allow steam to escape, this will reduce
          the liquid volume and allow it to thicken.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Simmer for at least an hour, up to an hour and a half depending on how
          thick you want to make it (keep in mind it will thicken further as it
          cools). If you're cooking pasta alongside, a dash of pasta water will
          add some starch to help thicken it a little.
        </p>
        <p>
          As always, please taste and season as you go, add pepper to taste towards the start of this cooking time, depending on how much bite you want to give it.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
