# TOPRecipes
TOP Recipe pages repo

Making this project to complete the recipes process in the Odin Project HTML course.

Here i'll create a nicely laid out homepage and index of recipes that can be visited, with images of the food at the top of each recipe. 

I'll come back later to add some design elements to the page using CSS
